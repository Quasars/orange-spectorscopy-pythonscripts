# orange-spectorscopy-pythonscripts

This is a collection of Python scripts for the `Python Script` widget and also as very early prototypes to be implemented as a widget or a preprocessor. However, all scripts in this repository should be functional when inserted in the `Python Script` widget. Please add proper documentation.

`Python Script` scripts should go in the _script_ folder and prototypes into the _prototype_ folder.
